# React GraphQL TypeScript Project Template

## In Progress...

This is a React GraphQL project template. It doesn't include the graphql backend server at the moment. 
Using:
- React
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- Apollo
- Apollo Codegen


## (1) Get Started âœ¨

For the local development, this requires to have a graphql backend services running at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

To generate types we need to run `yarn codegen`. Types are generated by hitting the schema api in the backend server. The backend server URL can be changed in `.env`.
