# Getting the code gen

So far... it is the same as `amplify codegen` command. 

Setting up Apollo & codegen

1. Installation

```bash
yarn add @apollo/client graphql
yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/typescript
```

2. Initialise graphql-codegen

see: https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/installation

```bash
yarn graphql-codegen init
```
